# Parrot

Parrot simplifies the translation management process right within Figma. If you deal with multilingual design projects and want to streamline your translation workflow, this plugin is for you! 

### Key Features:

* **Design in Different Languages**: Create and manage multiple language versions of your designs within your Figma file. Say goodbye to swiching interfaces for text and translation managment - all right within figma.
* **Localized Messages Made Easy**: With Parrot, managing localized Messages has never been more convenient. Assign unique names to messages used in your design or link to existing ones - thats it. 
* **Import** from i18Next, Android and iOS: Seamlessly import existing messages from Android and iOS projects or i18Next JSON format to jumpstart your localization efforts.
* **Export** with Ease: Effortlessly export your translated content to Android and iOS projects for a smooth handoff to developers. i18Next and CLI support is also coming soon!
